        <p>Hello there and welcome to my page! I am brand new to this massive coding world and
          hope to join many others in becoming a developer.
          <p>First, let's get to know who I am:
            Currently, I work as an operations coordinator at an e-commerce retail company. The bulk of my
            duties include day-to-day data entry tasks, analysis, building and running reports for my
            operations team. I am also a Cal State Fullerton alumi, from the class of 2018 with a Bachelors
            in Human Communication Studies and an emphasis on Interpersonal Communication. On my off-time, you
            would typically find me at the gym powerlifting or weightlifting. Fitness is my life and it's pretty much
            what I like to do for "fun". Aside from that, I also enjoy spending time outside to remind myself there's
            still a world out there that awaits me.
            <p>
              One of the reasons why I want to delve into this industry is because I recently realized how much I found
              myself enjoying styling the content of a blog (most commonly MySpace and Tumblr back in the old days--never thought
              I'd be saying that now). My peers that have already succeeded in attaining a career in development also motivated
              me to give this coding journey a shot, purely based off how happy they have been. They have been very open and willing
              to persuade me to tackle coding, all while reminding me about my potential.
              <p>This is only square one, but let's hope I can ride this out to the end and beyond!</p>
